# Team Profile Generator

Developer: Sydney Mercier

For: UT Austin Coding Bootcamp

## Overview

This is a CLI app that generates an HTML file based on user input for a styled team profile webpage. The [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) is used to present prompts to the user. First the user must enter a manager employee, and then can enter any number of engineers or interns. All entered employees are output to the HTML page as neatly organized cards.

The [Jest package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest) was used for testing.
